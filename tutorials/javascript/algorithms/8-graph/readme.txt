Graphs
    
    A Graph is an abstract model of a network structure. A graph is a set of nodes(vertices) connected by edges.
    
    Vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent vertices.
    A degree of a vertex consists of the number of adjacent vertices.
    A path is a sequence of consecutive vertices.
    A simple path does not contain repeated vertices.
    
    Directed and undirected graphs.
