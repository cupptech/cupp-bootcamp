Big-O notation

	It is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Understanding big-O notation

	How do we measure the efficiency of an algorithm? We usually use resources such
	as CPU (time) usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network usage. When talking
	about big-O notation, we usually consider CPU (time) usage.


	Bubble Sort			O(n^2)
	Merge Sort			O(nlog(n))
	Quick Sort 			O(nlog(n))
	Sequential search	O(n)
	Binary search		O(log(n))
