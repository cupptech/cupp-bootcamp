Trees

    Non sequential data structure.
    Very useful for storing information that need to be found easily.
    A tree is an abstract model of a hierarchical structure.
    
    The top node of a tree is called the root.
    Each element of the tree is called node.
    A node that does not have children is called leaf.
    A subtree consists of a node and its descendants.
    The depth of a node consists of the number of ancestors.
    The height of a tree consists of the maxmium depth of any node.
    
    A node in a binary tree has at most two children: one left child and one right child.
    A binary search tree, allows to store nodes with lesser values on the left side and nodes with greater values on the right side.
