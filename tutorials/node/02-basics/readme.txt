Node.js

	Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Features of Node.js

	Asynchronous and Event Driven
	Very Fast: Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, very fast in code execution.
	Single Threaded but Highly Scalable
	No Buffering - Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
